# Next.js + Playwright + GitHub Actions Boilerplate
Foresight integrated, comprehensive Todo app  with APIs, E2E tests with GitHub Actions enabled. 

## Built with
- [Next.js Todo App with Upstash](https://upstash.com/blog/nextjs-todo)
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev)
- [Foresight](https://runforesight.com)

## Setup guide

[Read the official blog](https://www.runforesight.com/blog/next-js-playwright-github-actions-boilerplate)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
a
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
